### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm, Ã˜ystein, a creative front-end developer who cares deeply about user experience. I love working with music, design, web development, photography and new technologies.

I enjoy a good cup of coffee at my desk, discussing innovative projects, playing video games and designing smooth user experiences.

### What I'm currently working on ðŸ”­
- A completely new website for my freelance digital development business
- A complete redesign and re-development of [arkentype.com](https://arkentype.com)

You can reach me by emailing [hello@wangen.digital](mailto:hello@wangen.digital)
