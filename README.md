### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm, Ã˜ystein, a creative front-end developer who cares deeply about user experience. I love working with music, design, web development, photography and new technologies.

I enjoy a good cup of coffee at my desk, discussing innovative projects, playing video games and designing smooth user experiences.
